""" Function for an automatic k-fold Cross-Validation of the Neural Network model by
    running the whole pipeline several times with different data set combinations.

Args:
    sample_list (list of indices):          A list of sample indicies which will be used for validation.
    model (Neural Network model):           Instance of a Neural Network model class instance.
    k_fold (integer):                       The number of k-folds for the Cross-Validationself. By default, a
                                            3-fold Cross-Validation is performed.
    evaluation_path (string):               Path to the evaluation data directory. This directory will be created and
                                            used for storing all kinds of evaluation results during the validation processes.
    draw_figures (boolean):                 Option if evaluation figures should be automatically plotted in the evaluation
                                            directory.
    detailed_evaluation (boolean):          Option if a detailed evaluation (additional prediction) should be performed.
    callbacks (list of Callback classes):   A list of Callback classes for custom evaluation.
