    """ Initialization function for creating a Neural Network (model) object.
    This class provides functionality for handling all model methods.
    This class runs the whole pipeline and uses a Preprocessor instance to obtain batches.

    With an initialized Neural Network model instance, it is possible to run training, prediction
    and evaluations.

    Args:
        preprocessor (Preprocessor):            Preprocessor class instance which provides the Neural Network with batches.
        architecture (Architecture):            Instance of a neural network model Architecture class instance.
                                                By default, a standard U-Net is used as Architecture.
        loss (Metric Function):                 The metric function which is used as loss for training.
                                                Any Metric Function defined in Keras, in miscnn.neural_network.metrics or any custom
                                                metric function, which follows the Keras metric guidelines, can be used.
        metrics (List of Metric Functions):     List of one or multiple Metric Functions, which will be shown during training.
                                                Any Metric Function defined in Keras, in miscnn.neural_network.metrics or any custom
                                                metric function, which follows the Keras metric guidelines, can be used.
        epochs (integer):                       Number of epochs. A single epoch is defined as one iteration through the complete data set.
        learning_rate (float):                  Learning rate in which weights of the neural network will be updated.
        batch_queue_size (integer):             The batch queue size is the number of previously prepared batches in the cache during runtime.
        gpu_number (integer):                   Number of GPUs, which will be used for training.
