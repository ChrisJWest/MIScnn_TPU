    """ Initialization function for creating a Preprocessor object.
    This class provides functionality for handling all preprocessing methods. This includes diverse
    optional preprocessing subfunctions like resampling, clipping, normalization or custom subfcuntions.
    This class processes the data into batches which are ready to be used for training, prediction and validation.

    The user is only required to create an instance of the Preprocessor class with the desired specifications
    and Data IO instance (optional also Data Augmentation instance).

    Args:
        data_io (Data_IO):                      Data IO class instance which handles all I/O operations according to the user
                                                defined interface
        data_aug (Data_Augmentation):           Data Augmentation class instance which performs diverse data augmentation techniques
        subfunctions (list of Subfunctions):    List of Subfunctions class instances which will be SEQUENTIALLY executed on the data set.
                                                (clipping, normalization, resampling, ...)
        batch_size (integer):                   Number of samples inside a single batch
        patchwise_analysis (boolean):           Boolean decision, if a full-image analysis or a patch-wise analysis should be performed
        patch_shape (integer tuple):            Size and shape of a patch. The variable has to be defined as a tuple.
                                                For Example: (64,128,128) for 64x128x128 patch cubes.
                                                Be aware that the x-axis represents the number of slices in 3D volumes.
                                                This parameter will be redundant if full image analysis is selected
                                                (patchwise_analysis is False)
        random_crop (boolean):                  In patchwise_analysis, patches will be randomly cropped from the image if this variable
                                                is True. If this parameter is false, the complete image will be sliced into a grid of
                                                patches.
                                                This parameter will be redundant if full image analysis is selected
                                                (patchwise_analysis is False)
        overlap (integer tuple):                In patchwise_analysis and without random cropping, an overlap can be defined between
                                                adjuncted patches.
                                                This parameter will be redundant if full image analysis is selected
                                                (patchwise_analysis is False).
                                                Only relevant if random_crop is False.
        skip_blanks (boolean):                  In patchwise_analysis and without random cropping, patches, containing only the
                                                background annotation, can be skipped with this option.
                                                This result into only training on relevant patches and ignore patches without any
                                                information.
                                                This parameter will be redundant if full image analysis is selected
                                                (patchwise_analysis is False).
                                                Only relevant if random_crop is False.
